<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üëâ About The Project

This is the Final Capstone Project for Microverse Complete Technical Curriculum. The implementation was completely built with  React, using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) command, and with Redux architecture, for managing the internal state of the applicacion.

The purpose of the project is to follow industry standards and present a complete application for booking appointments with the given design and requirements for its behaviour. As well we should choose a nice to have requirement, for Tiltzin I choose to work on transitions for making the user experience better, and in general, I worked in the front end design, as well as in the user authentication.
In order to achieve all of this we should implement the best practices learned throught the program.

## üëâ Tiltzin

Tiltzin is an applications por medium screens and large screens, it's layout works up 650px, it tries to be a tourism agency but wants to be something more, its an application that allows you to connect with indigenous and ethnic people in order to be a responsible traveller, and/or tourist, with the natural environment and culture of the desired destiny, you can reserve a day for meeting and a family that belongs to the culture heritage of the area will be responsible of the lead activies booked for that destiny.

The style and desgin of the page was made thinking in the colors that represents the imaginery of indigenous ethnic groups of people in Mexico, but at the same time, it mix a much more modern approach in order to make it attractive to the eye.

### What to expect in the future

Right now, as is it made, Tiltzin lacks of a sessions proper storage due to a problem with the domain name, you have to sign in everytime you reload the page, this problem will be fixed in the future, once the domain is available.
